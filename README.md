# Bayesian smoothers

This is a personal archive of implementations of various Bayesian smoothers. A large part is based on Simon Särkkä's book ["Bayesian Filtering & Smoothing"](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/bayesian-filtering-and-smoothing/C372FB31C5D9A100F8476C1B23721A67) (highly recommended).

Warning: This is not a software package. These implementations are just for me to better understand these algorithms. It may be challenging to apply this code as some filters contain hard-coded model choices.
