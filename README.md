# Bayesian smoothers

An archive of personal implementations of various Bayesian smoothers.

---

Collection contains:

- Standard Kalman (i.e., Rauch-Tung-Striebel) smoother
- Variational smoother for linear Gaussian state-space models

---

Warning: This is not a software package. These implementations are just for me to better understand these algorithms. It may be challenging to apply this code as some filters contain hard-coded model choices.
